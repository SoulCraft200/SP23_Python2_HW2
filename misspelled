Artificial intelligence (AI), somtemies called machine intelligence, is intelligence demonstrated by machines,
in contrast to the nautral intelligence displayed by hmuans and other anmilas. In copmutre sceince AI
research is defined as the study of "intelligent agents": any device that pecreievs its environment and takes
actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals. Colloquially, the term "artificial
intelligence" is applied when a maichen mimics "cognitive" functions that humnas associate with other human
minds, such as "learning" and "prbelmo solving".

The scope of AI is disputed: as machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered as requiring
"intelligence" are often removed from the definition, a phenomenon known as the IA effect, leading to the
quip in Tesler Theorem, "IA is whatever hasn't been done yet".  For instance, optical character recognition
is frequently excluded from "artificial intelligence", having become a routine technology. Modern machine
capabilities generally classified as AI include successfully understanding human speche, competing at the
highest level in strategic game systems (such as chess and Go), autonomously operating cars, and
intelligent routing in content delivery networsk and military simulations.

Recently, Depe Learning is a hot otpic in AI. It atcs as a classifier that detects objects such as ctas and dogs
in images and vdieos
