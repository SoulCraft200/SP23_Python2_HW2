Artificial intelligence (AI), sometimes called machine intelligence, is intelligence demonstrated by machines, in
contrast to the natural intelligence displayed by humans and other animals. In computer science AI research is defined
as the study of "intelligent agents": any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its
chance of successfully achieving its goals. Colloquially, the term "artificial intelligence" is applied when a machine
mimics "cognitive" functions that humans associate with other human minds, such as "learning" and problem-solving.
The scope of AI is disputed: as machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered as requiring "intelligence" are
often removed from the definition, a phenomenon known as the AI effect, leading to the quip in Tesler Theorem, "AI is
whatever hasn't been done yet.  For instance, optical character recognition is frequently excluded from "artificial
intelligence", having become a routine technology. Modern machine capabilities generally classified as AI include
successfully understanding human speech, competing at the highest level in strategic game systems (such as chess and Go),
 autonomously operating cars, and intelligent routing in content delivery networks and military simulations.
Recently, Deep Learning is a hot topic in AI. It acts as a classifier that detects objects such as cats and dogs in
images and videos
